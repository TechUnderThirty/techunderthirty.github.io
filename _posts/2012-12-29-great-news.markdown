As a new year comes upon us, we know the date, time, and place for our first event. We’re happy to announce that our first event will be at [Hive at 55](http://hiveat55.com/)! Once we get the event running on the [Eventbrite page](http://techunderthirty.eventbrite.com/), we’ll notify you guys with the official information!

####Lesson of the year:
If you work hard and don’t give up, you can make anything happen. After wonderful things happen to you, be prepared to keep it going!
